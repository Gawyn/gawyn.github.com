  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rails is simple. Rails is beautiful. Rails is magical. But when the amount of users starts to grow, it&#8217;s time to go back to the basics and refactor your code to improve the performance.</p>

<p>This article is NOT about architecture (you can read a great article about that <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/4/15/scaling-pinterest-from-0-to-10s-of-billions-of-page-views-a.html">here</a>. This article is about some very basic tips and tools that all Rails developers should use when trying to improve their application performance. Things like:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Caching</strong>: Rails provides three different kinds of caching: page, action and fragment caching. Page and action caching do basically the same: cache all the action. The main difference is that action caching gets to the Rails stack and it processes the controller <code>before_filter</code> hooks. This is mandatory if you are using authentication, for example.</li>
</ul>


<p>Anyway, action and page caching are deprecated in Rails 4. The real thing here is fragment caching: to cache any part of a process, including part of view rendering. This is specially useful in expensive calculations that don&#8217;t change in a long time, like periodical statistics. In Playfulbet, I cache using memcached and <a href="https://github.com/mperham/dalli">dalli</a>.</p>

<p>For a better understanding of Rails caching, I would recommend to read the episode Obie Fernandez wrote about it in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rails-Way-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Ruby/dp/0321601661">The Rails 3 Way</a>. <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html">Rails documentation</a> is fine, too.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Eager loading</strong>: Eager loading is a way to fetch all the associated objects with a single DB query.</li>
</ul>


<p>An example:</p>

<pre><code>user.bets.map { |bet| bet.option.odds }
</code></pre>

<p>This code will result in 1 + n calls to the DB, where n is the number of bets that the user has.</p>

<pre><code>user.bets.includes(:option).map { |bet| bet.option.odds }
</code></pre>

<p>This code will result in 2 calls to the DB.</p>

<p>You also can include a deep hierarchy of associations using a hash: <code>user.bets.includes(:option =&gt; {:market =&gt; :event})</code>. Eager loading also accepts a <code>:conditions</code> option.</p>

<p>There is another issue with eager loading: that it is not lazy. That means that the query will get executed in the controller, not in the view: and that could lead to unnecessary queries (for example, if part of the view is cached).</p>

<p>You can learn more about it in this <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/22-eager-loading?view=asciicast">Railscast episode</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Materialize</strong>: If you need to materialize attributes, just do it. As a rule of thumb, accessing the DB is &#8220;cheaper&#8221; than processing in Ruby (it&#8217;s a general rule, there are plenty of exceptions). Reading an attribute is better than calling a method that calculates it. Pretty obvious, no?</li>
</ul>


<p>The &#8220;materialize&#8221; rule has another meaning: to avoid recurring queries materializing the value in a column. A basic example of this philosophy is counter-cache, a DB column automatically updated by Rails that saves the total amount of a multiple association. Like this, it completely removes the burden of a recurring <code>SELECT COUNT(*)</code>.</p>

<p>There is a third meaning: to materialize in a model an attribute of another model that the former is using recurringly. You need to be EXTRA cautious about that -somehow it&#8217;s a violation of basic OOP principles- and only use it when it will make a big difference in performance. For example, when there are many classes between the accessor and the accessed.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Use <code>pluck</code></strong>: If you are using queries that return a large amount of records, that&#8217;s a big burden for your server&#8217;s memory. That&#8217;s specially not optimal if you only need a single column of the record.</li>
</ul>


<p><code>pluck</code>, a method added to Rails in 3.2, solves that problem. Essentially, it selects a single column in your SQL query. I will give you a real example from Playfulbet code. In the first case, we make a <code>Bet</code> query loading thousands of <code>User</code> objects, which are quite heavy:</p>

<pre><code>user_ids = User.where("created_at &lt; ?", Time.now.beginning_of_month).map(&amp;:id)
Bet.where(:user_id =&gt; user_ids)
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand, this loads only an array of integers for making the same query:</p>

<pre><code>user_ids = User.where("created_at &lt; ?", Time.now.beginning_of_month).pluck(:id)
Bet.where(:user_id =&gt; user_ids)
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><strong>Learn how your 3rd party code works</strong>: In this case, prevention is better than cure: choose very carefully your gems. Go for those who have a full test suite and GitHub activity. And even those have to be learnt, as the use you are doing of them can be optimized for your own purposes.</li>
</ul>


<p>A simple example: the very popular <code>will_paginate</code> performs a <code>SELECT COUNT</code> query to calculate the number of pages. This query can be avoided if you materialize its result and pass it directly to the paginate method in the <code>:total_entries</code> option. In this case, I paginate the bets of a user without querying the total amount and using counter-cache:</p>

<pre><code>@bets = @user.bets.paginate(:page =&gt; params[:page], :total_entries =&gt; @user.bets_count)
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some weeks ago, my partner and me made a pitch at one of the most important investment forums in Spain, the First Tuesday. In it, we presented <a href="http://playfulbet.com">Playfulbet</a> to Business Angels and Venture Capital Funds. And it looks like that they liked our project, as <strong>the assistants chose us as the best project presented.</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/blog/2013/01/14/one-graph-to-rule-them-all/">In my last post</a>, I showed you <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/itnig/open-graphpresentation">One Graph to rule the all</a>, the presentation I made at <a href="http://itnig.net/en/events/one-graph-to-rule-them-all-how-to-integrate-your-application-with-facebook">Itnig&#8217;s Fridays</a> (a popular event in the start-up scene in Barcelona).</p>

<p>This same presentation brought me a nice surprise today. It was featured in Slideshare homepage:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/slideshare/status/291448965008855040"><img class="center" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cristianplanas-blog/one-graph-to-rule-them-all-slideshare.png" title="Presenting Playfulbet to investors" alt="Pol and me presenting Playfulbet"></a>
<em>Sorry, I couldn&#8217;t take any screenshot of the actual Slideshare homepage.</em></p>

<p>Mine was the first Itnig&#8217;s Fridays presentation featured in this popular site homepage. I hope this helps to extend the use of Open Graph!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="http://playfulbet.com">Playfulbet</a>, we decided to use all the tools available to make ourselves viral since day one. And very soon we discovered that Facebook Open Graph was extremely valuable. Right now, this is giving us around <strong>600.000 prints and 5.000 clicks every month</strong>, totally for free. Also, given that the prints are triggered by users&#8217; actions, those numbers will increase with more users. So more users bring more Graph actions and more Graph actions bring more users. <strong>It&#8217;s a snowball effect: pure virality.</strong></p>

<p>To explain this, and much more, I made the presentation <em>One Graph to rule them all: Integrating your application with Facebook</em> at <a href="http://itnig.net/en/events/one-graph-to-rule-them-all-how-to-integrate-your-application-with-facebook">Itnig&#8217;s Fridays</a>. In the presentation, I described all the process that a developer must follow to publish its application&#8217;s actions in the Open Graph: asking the right permission from the user, creating a page for every object that will be used in the actions and, finally, defining the action itself. I also talked about the most typical issues: the weird behaviour of Facebook&#8217;s cache and the unpredictable response of Facebook staff when they have to approve your action. I finished the presentation remarking what a great difference can this make in your application visibility.</p>

<p>Usually all the Itnig&#8217;s Fridays talks are recorded, but this was lost because of some weird technical error. Anyway, if you have any doubts about the presentation or the Open Graph, you can tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/cristianplanas">@cristianplanas</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last month, after seven happy months working at <a href="http://itnig.net">Itnig</a>, I started a new professional challenge: from now, I am the CTO of <a href="http://playfulbet.com">Playfulbet</a>.</p>

<p>Until now, I was Senior Ruby developer and Project Manager at Itnig: a start-up accelerator. There I worked as developer in projects like PharmaDating or the Instituto Maxilofacial website. But my main task was being the project manager (and lead developer) of Playfulbet. And I liked the project so much that I decided to dedicate myself entirely to it.</p>

<p><a href="http://playfulbet.com"><img class="center" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cristianplanas-blog/playfulbet-with-characters.jpg" title="Playfulbet logo" alt="Playfulbet logo"></a></p>

<p>So a big nominal change (from Ruby developer in one company to CTO in another), but smaller in fact: I am still the man behind Playfulbet. Maybe the real change is philosophical. Before I was a developer who happened to like the start-up environment; now I am also risking myself as an entrepreneur.</p>

<p><a href="http://playfulbet.com"><img class="center" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cristianplanas-blog/pfb-en-cover.png" title="Playfulbet homepage" alt="Playfulbet homepage"></a></p>

<p>¿And why did I decide to risk myself? First of all, I think that Playfulbet is an extremely cool project with a bright future ahead. Playfulbet is a sports betting social game, a project that puts together two areas which are greatly growing: social gaming and gambling. Also it has some of the elements that attract me more to a project: big data (bets and users data) and a social aspect.</p>

<p>Wish me luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/blog/2012/09/11/baruco-2012-review/">As I told you some posts ago</a>, I loved the talk that Paolo Perrota gave at BaRuCo: <em>A short history of Software Engineering</em>. In it, Paolo explained showed why we, the developers/IT guys/nerds/whatever are not engineers and why the idea of &#8220;software engineering&#8221; itself is wrong. Also he showed us why developers can&#8217;t be replaced completely, as so many thought they would be. As he tells in the speak, when the complexity is in the problem, you can&#8217;t avoid it in the solution, and you need someone to overcome it.</p>

<p>Anyway it would be much better if the speaker explains himself:</p>

<p>PD: And by the way, in the last BaRuCo I was able to talk with him and get his book signed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Facebook organizes some events, the Facebook World Hacks, to evangelize developers with its newest features. Some days ago it was the turn of Barcelona, and I was able to assist.</p>

<p>The day started with some talks, where some Facebook employees presented all the features of the Open Graph: that was pretty convenient, as I am developing right now the Graph integration of <a href="http://playfulbet.com">Playfulbet</a>.</p>

<p>After the talks, the Hack itself started: all the developers there had to create teams and start building an application using the Graph. There was even some prizes for the best ones.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most of the assistants were PHP developers, so I decided to leave a bit earlier, without participating in the Hack. Sometimes I wish that Ruby was more mainstream!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last weekend I was able to assist to the <a href="http://www.baruco.org/">Barcelona Ruby Conference</a>, organized by our friends of <a href="http://www.codegram.com/">Codegram</a>. The list of speakers looked very promising and the event didn’t disappoint anyone.</p>

<p>First of all it&#8217;s important to remark how amazing the organization was: all the attendants were really well treated. In the picture below, you can see the delicious breakfast that we were able to enjoy just before the first speakers started:</p>

<p><a href="http://tweetmovies.net"><img class="center" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cristianplanas-blog/baruco_breakfast.jpg" title="Breakfast at BaRuCo" alt="A delicious breakfast for the BaRuCo attendants"></a></p>

<p>But the main point in any conference is the quality of the talks, and BaRuCo speakers did a real good job: the quantity of the talks was small compared to other conferences, but most of them were really interesting. Some of them were slightly too technical for the audience who approaches for the first time the topic that is exposed, but most of them found the perfect middleground between depth and simplicity. However, there were some that stood out&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bronze medal for&#8230;</strong>: <em>Programming workout</em> by Michal Taszycki. A description of how to get from beginner to master in any discipline, with some useful techniques for improving in any area. I really like this kind of talks with a broader, more humanistic scope.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Silver medal for&#8230;</strong>: <em>Micro-Service Architecture</em> by Fred George. I already praised in this blog <a href="/blog/2012/02/05/programmer-anarchy/">another awesome talk given by Mr. George</a>: he is a really gifted speaker. This time, he exposed how his company faced some difficult cases dividing the architecture in multiple applications, managing to reduce the complexity of the solution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gold medal for&#8230;</strong>: <em>Why Agile (A short history of software engineering, and other ideas that didn’t work)</em> by Paolo Perrotta: I was a big fan of Mr. Perrotta since I read Metaprogramming Ruby, a book which changed the way I understand developing; but now… fuck, everybody in the congress fell in love with him. He stole the show with a great and very funny talk about how the own concept of software engineering is a misunderstanding of our craft.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Summarizing, looks like that Barcelona has a new you-can&#8217;t-miss-it event. We are already waiting for 2013 tickets.</p>
