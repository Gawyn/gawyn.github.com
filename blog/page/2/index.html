  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some time ago, in an interview, I had to do a pretty simple JS problem. To write a function that would make all the elements in a menu to change color when the cursor passes on one of them: all the items except the one that has been &#8220;hovered&#8221;. Today I remembered it and decided to publish a solution here:</p>

<pre><code>change_color = function(){
  k = $(this); 
  if(!k.is(element)){ 
    k.css("background-color", "red")
  }
}

f = function(){
  element = $(this); 
  $.each($("#menu li"), change_color)
}

$("#menu li").on("hover", f)
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/blog/2012/09/11/baruco-2012-review/">As I told you some posts ago</a>, I loved the talk that Paolo Perrota gave at BaRuCo: <em>A short history of Software Engineering</em>. In it, Paolo explained showed why we, the developers/IT guys/nerds/whatever are not engineers and why the idea of &#8220;software engineering&#8221; itself is wrong. Also he showed us why developers can&#8217;t be replaced completely, as so many thought they would be. As he tells in the speak, when the complexity is in the problem, you can&#8217;t avoid it in the solution, and you need someone to overcome it.</p>

<p>Anyway it would be much better if the speaker explains himself:</p>

<p>PD: And by the way, in the last BaRuCo I was able to talk with him and get his book signed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Facebook organizes some events, the Facebook World Hacks, to evangelize developers with its newest features. Some days ago it was the turn of Barcelona, and I was able to assist.</p>

<p>The day started with some talks, where some Facebook employees presented all the features of the Open Graph: that was pretty convenient, as I am developing right now the Graph integration of <a href="http://playfulbet.com">Playfulbet</a>.</p>

<p>After the talks, the Hack itself started: all the developers there had to create teams and start building an application using the Graph. There was even some prizes for the best ones.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most of the assistants were PHP developers, so I decided to leave a bit earlier, without participating in the Hack. Sometimes I wish that Ruby was more mainstream!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last weekend I was able to assist to the <a href="http://www.baruco.org/">Barcelona Ruby Conference</a>, organized by our friends of <a href="http://www.codegram.com/">Codegram</a>. The list of speakers looked very promising and the event didn’t disappoint anyone.</p>

<p>First of all it&#8217;s important to remark how amazing the organization was: all the attendants were really well treated. In the picture below, you can see the delicious breakfast that we were able to enjoy just before the first speakers started:</p>

<p><a href="http://tweetmovies.net"><img class="center" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cristianplanas-blog/baruco_breakfast.jpg" title="Breakfast at BaRuCo" alt="A delicious breakfast for the BaRuCo attendants"></a></p>

<p>But the main point in any conference is the quality of the talks, and BaRuCo speakers did a real good job: the quantity of the talks was small compared to other conferences, but most of them were really interesting. Some of them were slightly too technical for the audience who approaches for the first time the topic that is exposed, but most of them found the perfect middleground between depth and simplicity. However, there were some that stood out&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bronze medal for&#8230;</strong>: <em>Programming workout</em> by Michal Taszycki. A description of how to get from beginner to master in any discipline, with some useful techniques for improving in any area. I really like this kind of talks with a broader, more humanistic scope.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Silver medal for&#8230;</strong>: <em>Micro-Service Architecture</em> by Fred George. I already praised in this blog <a href="/blog/2012/02/05/programmer-anarchy/">another awesome talk given by Mr. George</a>: he is a really gifted speaker. This time, he exposed how his company faced some difficult cases dividing the architecture in multiple applications, managing to reduce the complexity of the solution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gold medal for&#8230;</strong>: <em>Why Agile (A short history of software engineering, and other ideas that didn’t work)</em> by Paolo Perrotta: I was a big fan of Mr. Perrotta since I read Metaprogramming Ruby, a book which changed the way I understand developing; but now… fuck, everybody in the congress fell in love with him. He stole the show with a great and very funny talk about how the own concept of software engineering is a misunderstanding of our craft.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Summarizing, looks like that Barcelona has a new you-can&#8217;t-miss-it event. We are already waiting for 2013 tickets.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Long time without any update! I will try to be more perservering with my posts from now on.</p>

<p>In the next weeks I will explain some of my new projects, describing some of the difficulties I had to face and how I solved them. Mainly, issues with the architecture of a social sport betting application and a gem that I developed for it. But this won’t be today.</p>

<p>What I would like to explain today is how Drew Neil, the creator of <a href="http://vimcasts.org">Vimcasts</a> and author of <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim">Practical Vim</a> ran a Vim Masterclass at Itnig HQ, where I work. It was more than one month ago, but it was so cool that it is worth to write about it after so much time. :P</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cristianplanas-blog/drew_neil_and_me.jpg" title="Drew Neil and me" alt="With the creator of Vimcasts"></p>

<p>Talking about the workshop, my impression was very positive. As always with Vim, I really feel that I am using only a very small part of its amazing features. The workshop proved me right (about my own lack of skill, but right): Vim is as flexible as you want it to be, and it gives you the possibility to -as Neil’s book tells- “edit text at the speed of thought”.</p>

<p>PS: This weekend <a href="http://www.baruco.org/">Baruco</a> starts. I will be there, and I hope to tweet quite a lot about it. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/cristianplanas">@cristianplanas</a> on Twitter!</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2012-02-16T01:15:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 16<span>th</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Conditionals define the way in which a language specifies its logic. With
this, they not only define the way you are going to code: they are also
stating what you can do, and the way you are going to think and feel about your
applications. As I said in other entries, imagination is essential for a
good developer, and for having a free imagination, a simple and flexible
language -with its simple and flexible conditionals- is absolutely
required.</p>

<p>In this, Ruby also stands out. Developers not only are able to use the
usual if and else idioms, but count with some nice additions.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Improving negative conditions</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>In any kind of code, negative conditions are used quite often: and the
<code>if not</code> idiom is not natural at all. Ruby provides of an specific idiom
to state a negative condition: <code>unless</code>. For example, this:</p>

<pre><code>if array.length != 1
</code></pre>

<p>looks much more nice like this:</p>

<pre><code>unless array.length == 1
</code></pre>

<p>This also has its counterpart in loops, as until is the opposite of while.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ruby is an easy-going guy</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>And thinks that most of the time people are saying the truth. So when
Ruby evaluates a variable as a condition, everything except nil and
false will be passed as true. That has some interesting effects:</p>

<pre><code>if 0 puts 'C developers, 0 is true in Ruby!'
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><strong>Moving the condition to the end</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Ruby always try to be as readable as possible, so it adds a new way to
define a condition: leaving it after the actual code. For example,
following the example given before:</p>

<pre><code>puts 'C developers, 0 is true in Ruby!' if 0
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><strong>Conditions are executed in order</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>That&#8217;s a great help. For example, imagine we have this code:</p>

<pre><code>puts "The length is 2" unless a.nil? || a.length == 2
</code></pre>

<p>In the case that a is nil, in other languages we would have an
exception, as the nil element doesn&#8217;t have any method called length. But
Ruby is smart enough to know that in an OR you don&#8217;t need to evaluate
the other conditions if one is true.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The nil guard</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>When a Ruby beginners faces a piece of code, the most exotic idiom he
can find will probably this: ||=. This is called the nil guard. It comes
to save a typical problem: an assignation that only should be executed
when the variable assigned is nil.</p>

<pre><code>a ||= []
</code></pre>

<p>that&#8217;s much better than</p>

<pre><code>a = [] if a.nil?
</code></pre>

<p>it&#8217;s just more elegant. As you can see, the nil guard is related with
the executing the conditionals in order thing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When the Web is your passion, you don&#8217;t have enough with your job:
you continue developing your own tools or applications after hours. Web
developers like to have their own
projects, creations they can feel they own. That&#8217;s exactly my case.</p>

<p>One of those apps, probably my favorite, is
<a href="http://tweetmovies.net">TweetMovies</a>: a
special social network to discover great films and sharing your
opinion about any of your favorite, or least favorite, movies. <strong>&#8220;Tweet.
Read. Share. Discover cinema the social way!&#8221;</strong> is the motto of
<a href="http://tweetmovies.net">TweetMovies</a>, and everything in the application, from the specification
to the graphic design, is around that. In the end, we
live in the 2.0 world!</p>

<p><a href="http://tweetmovies.net"><img class="center" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cristianplanas-blog/project_tweetmovies.png" title="TweetMovies" alt="The cover of TweetMovies"></a></p>

<p>In the creation of <a href="http://tweetmovies.net">TweetMovies</a>, integration with other social networks
was truly important: users don&#8217;t need to register in TwM, as they can
access the main features of the application only logging in with your
Twitter account. <a href="http://tweetmovies.net">TweetMovies</a> also integrates with Facebook as any
comment written on our application can be redirected to the Twitter and FB
accounts of the users, giving you the power to share your views on
movies with your friends and the world.</p>

<p>One of the main goals of <a href="http://tweetmovies.net">TweetMovies</a> was to create a space where all the
opinions around the film world could be organized. Twitter and the other
social networks are fantastic jungles of information, an utopy for
any datamining lover. But often it&#8217;s hard to find interesting and
fair judgments about some topics: TwM tries to be a solution to that. The
opinions of our users are ranked by other users and our own algorithm,
giving them the chance to read first the most important ones. This way,
TwM tries to be not only a social tool, but also a point of reference
for anyone interested in movies. With
<a href="http://tweetmovies.net">TweetMovies</a>, you will get a quick
and attractive answer to the most typical questions: Should I watch
this movie? Is it good? <strong>In TweetMovies we don&#8217;t believe that a number is
enough, like other applications do. For us, words are more important than
numbers: anyone trusts more a friend giving a reasonable opinion than other saying &#8216;six point three&#8217;.</strong></p>

<p>Being a complex and modern application, in the creation of
<a href="http://tweetmovies.net">TweetMovies</a>
were used a great variety of tools. As a true Ruby believer, I used
Rails in the application development. For the integration with FB and
Twitter, Omniauth; for user authentication, Devise; and in the general
design of the site, Slim, Sass, CoffeeScript and JQuery. Lots of other
tools, mainly ruby gems, were used but it would be boring to talk about
all of them.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all. I hope you try and enjoy
<a href="http://tweetmovies.net">TweetMovies</a>. Because as Truffaut
said, <em>Le Cinema Règne!</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the <a href="http://rupy.eu/">Rupy 2011</a>, I assisted to some very interesting
conferences, like the ones by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/josevalim">José Valim</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/wycats">Yehuda Katz</a>.
 But the conference I remember the most is, by far, Programmer Anarchy.</p>

<p>In it, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/fgeorge52">Fred George</a> exposes with a great amount of humor a development
process where programmers are not just developing the application, but
designing and modifying it beyond the customer&#8217;s expectations. He
also reasons the need of removing certain roles (most of them, actually)
that don&#8217;t produce code in the development process. As the popular agile (or antiagile?) manifesto says&#8230;
<a href="http://programming-motherfucker.com/">Programming, Motherfucker!</a></p>

<p>Personally, I have always thought that developers should take a more
active role when discussing the application with the customer: how many
times have we ended coding some feature that we knew for sure that was
stupid? We have to remember that, in the end, we are fucking technology
experts, specially compared to most of the clients (yeah, not being too
humble now). We should be stakeholders, and not minor ones, of our own
projects.</p>

<p>Here you can watch the conference. I would recommend it, even if you are
not very interested in the topic. If you know the IT world, it&#8217;s really
hilarous:</p>
