    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since I read <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">The Lean Startup</a> for the first time, I have always been interested in metrics. Soon I discovered that developers have a nice advantage over pure marketing guys, as we are able to "cook" our own metrics and also we have a better understanding of how the metrics services as KISSmetrics or Mixpanel work. Actually, I like this topic so much that I started to code a metrics service called DataMorlock: I even bought the domain. Fear me, KISSmetrics!</p>

<p>Anyway, last week I was able to share my experiences on startup metrics in a talk in the <a href="http://www.conversionthursday.com/?p=2100">Conversion Thursday Barcelona</a>, a monthly event about web analytics and marketing online.</p>

<p>Unluckily, the talk was in Spanish: I hope my next one will be in English. Anyway, enjoy it!</p>
