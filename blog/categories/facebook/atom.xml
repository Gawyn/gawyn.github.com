    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook organizes some events, the Facebook World Hacks, to evangelize developers with its newest features. Some days ago it was the turn of Barcelona, and I was able to assist.</p>

<p>The day started with some talks, where some Facebook employees presented all the features of the Open Graph: that was pretty convenient, as I am developing right now the Graph integration of <a href="http://playfulbet.com">Playfulbet</a>.</p>

<p>After the talks, the Hack itself started: all the developers there had to create teams and start building an application using the Graph. There was even some prizes for the best ones.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most of the assistants were PHP developers, so I decided to leave a bit earlier, without participating in the Hack. Sometimes I wish that Ruby was more mainstream!</p>
