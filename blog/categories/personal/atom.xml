    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some weeks ago, my partner and me made a pitch at one of the most important investment forums in Spain, the First Tuesday. In it, we presented <a href="http://playfulbet.com">Playfulbet</a> to Business Angels and Venture Capital Funds. And it looks like that they liked our project, as <strong>the assistants chose us as the best project presented.</strong></p>

<p>Even if this victory doesn't imply any investment, it obviously shows the potential of <a href="http://playfulbet.com">Playfulbet</a>. We thank all the First Tuesday attendants for trusting us.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/blog/2013/01/14/one-graph-to-rule-them-all/">In my last post</a>, I showed you <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/itnig/open-graphpresentation">One Graph to rule the all</a>, the presentation I made at <a href="http://itnig.net/en/events/one-graph-to-rule-them-all-how-to-integrate-your-application-with-facebook">Itnig's Fridays</a> (a popular event in the start-up scene in Barcelona).</p>

<p>This same presentation brought me a nice surprise today. It was featured in Slideshare homepage:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/slideshare/status/291448965008855040"><img class="center" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cristianplanas-blog/one-graph-to-rule-them-all-slideshare.png" title="Presenting Playfulbet to investors" alt="Pol and me presenting Playfulbet"></a>
<em>Sorry, I couldn't take any screenshot of the actual Slideshare homepage.</em></p>

<p>Mine was the first Itnig's Fridays presentation featured in this popular site homepage. I hope this helps to extend the use of Open Graph!</p>

    <id>http://Gawyn.github.com/blog/2012/12/10/playfulbet</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month, after seven happy months working at <a href="http://itnig.net">Itnig</a>, I started a new professional challenge: from now, I am the CTO of <a href="http://playfulbet.com">Playfulbet</a>.</p>

<p>Until now, I was Senior Ruby developer and Project Manager at Itnig: a start-up accelerator. There I worked as developer in projects like PharmaDating or the Instituto Maxilofacial website. But my main task was being the project manager (and lead developer) of Playfulbet. And I liked the project so much that I decided to dedicate myself entirely to it.</p>

<p><a href="http://playfulbet.com"><img class="center" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cristianplanas-blog/playfulbet-with-characters.jpg" title="Playfulbet logo" alt="Playfulbet logo"></a></p>

<p>So a big nominal change (from Ruby developer in one company to CTO in another), but smaller in fact: I am still the man behind Playfulbet. Maybe the real change is philosophical. Before I was a developer who happened to like the start-up environment; now I am also risking myself as an entrepreneur.</p>

<p><a href="http://playfulbet.com"><img class="center" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cristianplanas-blog/pfb-en-cover.png" title="Playfulbet homepage" alt="Playfulbet homepage"></a></p>

<p>¿And why did I decide to risk myself? First of all, I think that Playfulbet is an extremely cool project with a bright future ahead. Playfulbet is a sports betting social game, a project that puts together two areas which are greatly growing: social gaming and gambling. Also it has some of the elements that attract me more to a project: big data (bets and users data) and a social aspect.</p>

<p>Wish me luck!</p>

    <updated>2012-02-08T22:37:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://Gawyn.github.com/blog/2012/02/08/presenting-tweetmovies</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When the Web is your passion, you don't have enough with your job:
you continue developing your own tools or applications after hours. Web
developers like to have their own
projects, creations they can feel they own. That's exactly my case.</p>

<p>One of those apps, probably my favorite, is
<a href="http://tweetmovies.net">TweetMovies</a>: a
special social network to discover great films and sharing your
opinion about any of your favorite, or least favorite, movies. <strong>"Tweet.
Read. Share. Discover cinema the social way!"</strong> is the motto of
<a href="http://tweetmovies.net">TweetMovies</a>, and everything in the application, from the specification
to the graphic design, is around that. In the end, we
live in the 2.0 world!</p>

<p><a href="http://tweetmovies.net"><img class="center" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cristianplanas-blog/project_tweetmovies.png" title="TweetMovies" alt="The cover of TweetMovies"></a></p>

<p>In the creation of <a href="http://tweetmovies.net">TweetMovies</a>, integration with other social networks
was truly important: users don't need to register in TwM, as they can
access the main features of the application only logging in with your
Twitter account. <a href="http://tweetmovies.net">TweetMovies</a> also integrates with Facebook as any
comment written on our application can be redirected to the Twitter and FB
accounts of the users, giving you the power to share your views on
movies with your friends and the world.</p>

<p>One of the main goals of <a href="http://tweetmovies.net">TweetMovies</a> was to create a space where all the
opinions around the film world could be organized. Twitter and the other
social networks are fantastic jungles of information, an utopy for
any datamining lover. But often it's hard to find interesting and
fair judgments about some topics: TwM tries to be a solution to that. The
opinions of our users are ranked by other users and our own algorithm,
giving them the chance to read first the most important ones. This way,
TwM tries to be not only a social tool, but also a point of reference
for anyone interested in movies. With
<a href="http://tweetmovies.net">TweetMovies</a>, you will get a quick
and attractive answer to the most typical questions: Should I watch
this movie? Is it good? <strong>In TweetMovies we don't believe that a number is
enough, like other applications do. For us, words are more important than
numbers: anyone trusts more a friend giving a reasonable opinion than other saying 'six point three'.</strong></p>

<p>Being a complex and modern application, in the creation of
<a href="http://tweetmovies.net">TweetMovies</a>
were used a great variety of tools. As a true Ruby believer, I used
Rails in the application development. For the integration with FB and
Twitter, Omniauth; for user authentication, Devise; and in the general
design of the site, Slim, Sass, CoffeeScript and JQuery. Lots of other
tools, mainly ruby gems, were used but it would be boring to talk about
all of them.</p>

<p>That's all. I hope you try and enjoy
<a href="http://tweetmovies.net">TweetMovies</a>. Because as Truffaut
said, <em>Le Cinema Règne!</em></p>

    <id>http://Gawyn.github.com/blog/2012/01/29/welcome-to-my-new-blog</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Being at the same time an IT guy and a literature lover, I guess it's normal I created a lot of blogs in my life: <a href="http://gawyn.blogspot.com/">El blog de Gawyn</a>, <a href="http://librosyfilms.wordpress.com/">Libros y Films</a>, and specially <a href="http://cafemarat.blogspot.com/">Café Marat</a> a blog with 73 (long) entries written in almost two years and that even after not being updated for more then three years, is still receiving almost 1.000 visits every month. I also created a cinema magazine, <a href="http://fundidoanegro.net">Fundido a Negro</a> that was also my first experience with Rails.</p>

<p>But, so far, this blogs were essencially about some of my other passions: literature and cinema. <strong>This blog will be different: it's main topic will be my experiences with Ruby and other languages.</strong> Of course, I know that it's always risky to predict the real content of something before creating it, but at least that is my purpose.</p>

<p>But why should a developer write about his job? First of all, to share the new lessons one takes everyday with other developers; right now, for any of us, it's impossible to think about how it would be our coding without the help of the community via Google, blogs or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a>. But also because, quoting Einstein:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.</p></blockquote>

<p>And that's enough for this entry. Let the real action begin!</p>
