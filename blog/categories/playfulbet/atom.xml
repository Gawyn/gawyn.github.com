    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some weeks ago, my partner and me made a pitch at one of the most important investment forums in Spain, the First Tuesday. In it, we presented <a href="http://playfulbet.com">Playfulbet</a> to Business Angels and Venture Capital Funds. And it looks like that they liked our project, as <strong>the assistants chose us as the best project presented.</strong></p>

<p>Even if this victory doesn't imply any investment, it obviously shows the potential of <a href="http://playfulbet.com">Playfulbet</a>. We thank all the First Tuesday attendants for trusting us.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month, after seven happy months working at <a href="http://itnig.net">Itnig</a>, I started a new professional challenge: from now, I am the CTO of <a href="http://playfulbet.com">Playfulbet</a>.</p>

<p>Until now, I was Senior Ruby developer and Project Manager at Itnig: a start-up accelerator. There I worked as developer in projects like PharmaDating or the Instituto Maxilofacial website. But my main task was being the project manager (and lead developer) of Playfulbet. And I liked the project so much that I decided to dedicate myself entirely to it.</p>

<p><a href="http://playfulbet.com"><img class="center" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cristianplanas-blog/playfulbet-with-characters.jpg" title="Playfulbet logo" alt="Playfulbet logo"></a></p>

<p>So a big nominal change (from Ruby developer in one company to CTO in another), but smaller in fact: I am still the man behind Playfulbet. Maybe the real change is philosophical. Before I was a developer who happened to like the start-up environment; now I am also risking myself as an entrepreneur.</p>

<p><a href="http://playfulbet.com"><img class="center" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cristianplanas-blog/pfb-en-cover.png" title="Playfulbet homepage" alt="Playfulbet homepage"></a></p>

<p>Â¿And why did I decide to risk myself? First of all, I think that Playfulbet is an extremely cool project with a bright future ahead. Playfulbet is a sports betting social game, a project that puts together two areas which are greatly growing: social gaming and gambling. Also it has some of the elements that attract me more to a project: big data (bets and users data) and a social aspect.</p>

<p>Wish me luck!</p>
